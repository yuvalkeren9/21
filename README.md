This is a Black Jack game I made for fun. I was reading the book "The pragmatic programmer" and decided to create a aproject, whilst reading it,
to implant the concepts that they teach in the book.

The main concepts I was using were:

1) The DRY principle (avoiding duplication of code)
2) Orthogonal code
3) The Law of Demeter

Midway through the project, I decided that I wanted to add a GUI, to seperate this project from "school like" projects and learn how to use public libraries.

So I decided to first finish the CMD version, and then add to it a layer of GUI that does not interfer with the CMD layer at all. That made some weird code at times, but 
I wanted to do it this way in order to stick to the above principles.

The libraby I decided to use for GUI is SFML. 

I learned many new concepts (aside from the GUI stuff) and I feel very comftrable with c++. 

If anyone is intersted with questions (or wants to try out the game without having to download SFML), hit me up :)
